                <blockquote>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is a domesticated, one-toed, hoofed mammal. It belongs to
                    the taxonomic family Equidae and is one of two extant subspecies of Equus ferus. The horse has
                    evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the
                    large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BCE, and their
                    domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BCE. Horses in the subspecies caballus are
                    domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral
                    populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been
                    domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related
                    concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds,
                    locomotion, and behavior.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It
                    has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of
                    its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent
                    mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult
                    males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on
                    large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
                    opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek
                    out and prey on humans.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>The leopard (Panthera pardus) is one of the five extant species in the genus Panthera, a
                    member of the cat family, Felidae. It occurs in a wide range in sub-Saharan Africa, in some parts of
                    Western and Central Asia, Southern Russia, and on the Indian subcontinent to Southeast and East
                    Asia. It is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because leopard populations are threatened by
                    habitat loss and fragmentation, and are declining in large parts of the global range. The leopard is
                    considered locally extinct in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, Jordan, Morocco, Togo, the United
                    Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Kuwait, Syria, Libya, Tunisia and most likely in
                    North Korea, Gambia, Laos, Lesotho, Tajikistan, Vietnam and Israel. Contemporary records suggest
                    that the leopard occurs in only 25% of its historical global range.
